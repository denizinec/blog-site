The use of 0-results-as-a-loading-indicator is really prevalent. It is horrible UX, as it is directly lying to the user.


Why is this a problem?
----------------------

"0 results" and "data is being loaded" are two different things, so we shouldn't collapse them as the
same message to the user.

Just today I opened Google Drive on Android and the data loading took so many seconds I had time to
scratch my head with "why is my Drive empty?", until I realized that maybe data is loading
(non-software people might not understand this and be even more confused than I was). And sure enough
a few seconds more and I saw my files.

The problem is worsened when the server is busy and it takes a long time for the server to respond
and thus the lie is visible for a long time.


This problem is everywhere
--------------------------

Google Drive:


I could go **on an on** where I find this.

Microsoft has had *decades* to improve Windows, but still when you go to count directory's files and
subdirs (from right click -> properties) it reports "0 files" for a while if the drive is slow to
list the files. Seriously, I'm supposed to know the counting is finished when the numbers don't change
for a while.

If I'm doing "data spring cleaning" and I see a directory that I think is empty,
I could mistakenly delete the directory as I know I don't need empty directories.
**In this case this leads to accidental data loss**, but this is
[expected when you use Microsoft products](https://www.howtogeek.com/658194/windows-10s-new-update-is-deleting-peoples-files-again/).


Why is this problem so widespread?
----------------------------------

Developers are lazy, and it seems really attractive to use the exact same code path for displaying
the "loading" page as for displaying the actual results when the server responds:

Data is loading: `renderResultsUI([])`

Data is loaded: `renderResultsUI(results)`

The first case semantically displays to the user a valid search result with 0 items.
I.e. a lie, because we don't know yet how many search results there will be.


Sidenote: combined with missing error handling
----------------------------------------------

Another pet peeve of mine is missing error handling, and you get extra stupid points when you combine it
with '0 results as a loading indicator'.
I witnessed Docker Hub show me "There are no results" for popular search terms that should definitely exist.

When I looked at the developer console, it turned out I was getting `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`
(or something to that effect which was fixed by logout-and-login), and I guess they either were
ignoring errors entirely OR assuming all errors are 404 (I think I remember seeing 404 text in UI)
and that 404 means 0 search results (which would still be semantically incorrect).


A solution
----------

A solution would be at the UI's data access API to force the developer to handle these data loading
states separately:

![Data is being loaded -> (Loaded successfully | Load errored)](data-loading-lifecycle.png)

In my TypeScript projects I use a `Result<T>` wrapper where I need to get the data I want by calling
`unwrap()` which makes the compiler force me to deal with `loadingOrError`. It contains either:

- the `loading` UI element (a loading indicator - a "spinner") OR
- an `error` message with correct visuals (red color etc.) applied OR
- nothing (no error or not loading, in this case data is set)

Its use looks like this:

```tsx
private renderReplicationStatusesView() {
	const [replicationStatuses, loadingOrError] = this.state.replicationStatuses.unwrap();

	if (!replicationStatuses || loadingOrError) {
		return loadingOrError;
	}

	return <ReplicationStatusesView replicationStatuses={replicationStatuses} />;
}
```

And the UI looks like this when the server is slow to respond:


And when the same request fails:



The code
--------

For the curious, the code for `Result<T>` wrapper is
[here](https://github.com/function61/f61ui/blob/c28d1a42b1992f6c41f2e13e9244ec49772f228e/component/result.tsx).

A few caveats:

- It contains extra code and support for a case where the first state of lifecycle is
  "data loading has not been started", e.g. if the record-to-be-fetched is only known after a user
  action so this `Result` can exist before the data's fetching is started.
- It also contains other features like reloading the same data or different data (call `.load()` multiple times)
- Above cases probably could be implemented in a cleaner way outside of this `Result` now that I think of it.
- It is coupled to React-like architecture expectations, where you're supposed to use it in your UI like this:

```tsx
export default class VolumesAndMountsPage extends React.Component<VolumesAndMountsPageProps, VolumesAndMountsPageState> {
	state: VolumesAndMountsPageState = {
		volumes: new Result<Volume[]>((volumes) => {
			// when state of "volumes result" changes, trigger re-render of UI by
			// hackily re-setting "us" to state
			this.setState({ volumes: volumes });
		}),
	}

	componentDidMount() {
		this.fetchData();
	}

	render() {
		this.renderVolumes();
	}

	private renderVolumes() {
		const [volumes, loadingOrError] = this.state.volumes.unwrap();

		if (!volumes || loadingOrError) {
			return loadingOrError;
		}

		return <VolumesView volumes={volumes} />;
	}

	private fetchData() {
		// getVolumes() returns Promise<Volume[]> and internally does a HTTP get to the server
		this.state.volumes.load(() => getVolumes());
	}
}
```
