title: Displaying RSS feed with Home Assistant
---

I wanted to display news in my Home Assistant dashboard.

Home Assistant has "[Feedreader](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/feedreader/)"
integration which supports getting data from an RSS feed into HA's event bus, but it doesn't
mention a way of *displaying* the entries (or storing them as sensor attributes that would
be accessible from UI).

There's
[3rd party integration and an UI component to do the job](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-rss-feed-parser-plugin-list-card/64637),
but I wanted to do this with as close to vanilla Home Assistant as possible. (I'm especially
hesitant to add 3rd party HTML/JS into the mix.)

It's surprising there's no way to do this, given that Home Assistant supports so many common
things out of the box.


My first, bad solution
----------------------

My na√Øve first solution was to use an `<iframe>`-based RSS widget, which Home Assistant
supports ([Webpage card](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/iframe/)), and it worked
but had the following caveats:

- It was surprisingly hard to find a free RSS-as-iframe-widget service, I think I landed
  with [RSS Dog](https://www.rssdog.com/) as the least bad option
- The external service's visual theme probably doesn't match with your Home Assistant theme's visuals
- Home Assistant doesn't support periodic refreshes, so you're stuck with the RSS widget
  service's own refresh feature - if it has one to begin with
- Iframes are always much heavier to execute than just have Home Assistant natively display its own data


A better solution
-----------------

My solution was to:

- Have a script outside of Home Assistant pull the RSS feed
- Transform it into Markdown
- Push it via Home Assistant's [HTTP API as a sensor attribute](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#sensor)
	* It **needs to be an attribute** (not a state), because Home Assistant limits state values to <= 255 chars
- Display the Markdown in UI as a Markdown card with a template that accesses the sensor attribute

Pushing news to Home Assistant looks somewhat like this:

	$ curl \
	    -x '{"state":"", "attributes": {"content_md": "- News item 1\n- News item 2"}}' \
	    -h "Content-Type: application/json" \
	    -h "Authorization: Bearer ..." \
	    http://localhost:8123/api/states/sensor.mynews

The content (in our case, a
[template](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/#home-assistant-template-extensions))
for the Markdown card looks like this:

	{{state_attr('sensor.mynews', 'content_md')}}

Hope this helps you!

UPDATE: Someone asked me for my code, and I decided to polish it a bit and put it up as a
ready-to-use program: [RSS-to-homeassistant](https://github.com/joonas-fi/rss-to-homeassistant).


My over-engineered solution
---------------------------

Now this one is for total nerds and not related to Home Assistant anymore..

Since I had to do the RSS pulling myself anyway, and I am software engineer and a
[data hoarder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/), I push all new RSS items into an
event log (therefore I can store the news timeline forever) whose events get pushed to my
Home Assistant in realtime.
