title: I forgot my password to my Unifi controller

Backstory
---------

Recently I purchased some [Unifi](https://unifi-sdn.ubnt.com/) gear, and I installed the
controller software mainly as a test, and thus I did not immediately save the username and
password in a password manager but instead I probably wrote it down in Windows Notepad,
and Windows 10 being a total dick, just one day restarted losing what I had in notepad.

Some time passed, and I forgot not only the password, but also the username. Then I
realized that once the Unifi gear is
[adopted](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/204909754-UniFi-Device-Adoption-Methods-for-Remote-UniFi-Controllers)
to the controller, it would require some effort to re-adopt and configure the gear into a
new instance of the controller - so I was left scratching my head as to how to break in.

Lesson learned: recognize the fact that a "test installation" might be promoted to production.

Here's a small explorative story of my thought process and how I managed to "break in" back
to my Unifi controller. Quotes, because it's not much hacking when I had root access to to
the VM the controller was running in.

It's also a side story of the powerful help in MongoDB that helped me go from zero to doing
something meaningful in a really short time.

The objective: find out the username and reset the password.


First try: "Forgot password?" dialog
------------------------------------

My first instinct was to try the "Forgot password?" feature. I gave the correct email, but
the password reset link never came. I guess I should have configured some SMTP defails when
I set up the controller..


Second try: explore the filesystem
----------------------------------

I didn't find the user account details by exploring the Unifi controller's saved files in the filesystem.


Third try: explore the database
-------------------------------

I am running the
[controller as a Docker image](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles/blob/master/unifi/Dockerfile)
from the ever awesome [Jessfraz](https://jessfraz.com/).

After entering the container, `$ mongo` (the CLI for MongoDB) didn't exist, so we need to install it:

	$ apt search mongo
	mongodb-org-server/now 3.4.17 amd64 [installed,local]
	  MongoDB database server

I should be able to see more MongoDB related stuff, so because they're missing we must
refresh package index. Also, from the above package we know we probably should search with
"mongodb-org":

	$ apt update
	$ apt search mongodb-org
	mongodb-org/xenial 3.4.17 amd64
	  MongoDB open source document-oriented database system (metapackage)
	
	mongodb-org-mongos/xenial 3.4.17 amd64
	  MongoDB sharded cluster query router
	
	mongodb-org-server/xenial,now 3.4.17 amd64 [installed]
	  MongoDB database server
	
	mongodb-org-shell/xenial 3.4.17 amd64
	  MongoDB shell client
	
	mongodb-org-tools/xenial 3.4.17 amd64
	  MongoDB tools
	
	
	# great, so it's mongodb-org-shell
	
	$ apt install mongodb-org-shell

Running `$ mongo` now works but it didn't manage to connect to the default TCP port.
What port is it running in?

	$ netstat -na | grep mongo
	unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     22071    /usr/lib/unifi/run/mongodb-27117.sock

Oh it listens only to a Unix socket, so let's try it:

	$ mongo --host /usr/lib/unifi/run/mongodb-27117.sock
	MongoDB shell version v3.4.17
	connecting to: mongodb://%2Fusr%2Flib%2Funifi%2Frun%2Fmongodb-27117.sock/
	MongoDB server version: 3.4.17
	Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
	For interactive help, type "help".

Awesome, we're in! Knowing nothing about MongoDB, I appreciate the hint of starting with `help`:

	> help
	    db.help()                    help on db methods
	    db.mycoll.help()             help on collection methods
	    sh.help()                    sharding helpers
	    rs.help()                    replica set helpers
	    help admin                   administrative help
	    help connect                 connecting to a db help
	    help keys                    key shortcuts
	    help misc                    misc things to know
	    help mr                      mapreduce

	    show dbs                     show database names
	    show collections             show collections in current database
	    show users                   show users in current database
	    show profile                 show most recent system.profile entries with time >= 1ms
	    show logs                    show the accessible logger names
	    show log [name]              prints out the last segment of log in memory, 'global' is default
	    use <db_name>                set current database
	    db.foo.find()                list objects in collection foo
	    db.foo.find( { a : 1 } )     list objects in foo where a == 1
	    it                           result of the last line evaluated; use to further iterate
	    DBQuery.shellBatchSize = x   set default number of items to display on shell
	    exit                         quit the mongo shell

Ok so we can start by listing databases:

	> show dbs
	ace       0.003GB
	ace_stat  0.006GB
	admin     0.000GB
	local     0.000GB

The DBs `admin` and `local` are probably some MongoDB system stuff, so we're left with `ace` and `ace_stat`.
The latter is probably related to statistics storage, so `ace` is our best bet.

Again, the `help` command also told us how to "enter" a database:

	> use ace
	switched to db ace

The `help` command also taught us how to list "tables" (collections in MongoDB terminology):

	> show collections
	account
	admin
	alarm
	broadcastgroup
	dashboard
	device
	...
	scheduletask
	setting
	site
	stat
	tag
	task
	user
	usergroup
	verification
	virtualdevice
	voucher
	wall
	wlanconf
	wlangroup

We're probably interested either in `admin`, `account` or the `user` collection.

Conveniently, the same top-level help also taught us how to list objects in the collection:

	> db.user.find()
	{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b94d704c8df8b0001ab6b5a"), "mac" : "08:00:27:...", "site_id" : "5b94d698c8df...", "oui" : "PcsSyste", "is_guest" : false, "first_seen" : NumberLong(1536481028), "last_seen" : NumberLong(1538481428), "is_wired" : true, "name" : "...", "usergroup_id" : "", "noted" : true, "hostname" : "..." }
	much more rows like above... (some data was masked for my privacy)

Ok those are devices in my network, so that's the wrong collection. Next we'll try `admin`:

	> db.admin.find()
	{ "_id" : ObjectId("5b94d6d1c8df8b0001ab6b4e"), "email" : "...", "last_site_name" : "default", "name" : "joonas", "time_created" : NumberLong(1536480977), "x_shadow" : "$6$dCFzb1Vb$D2AV2BnF2.hbLY3tMD7w4c5Xbjz/..." }
	(again, some data masked with dots for privacy)

Bingo! And don't bother with even the cut portion of my password hash, because I never use
the same password twice.

The password is stored in field `x_shadow`. The hash looks familiar but I don't know it
from the top of my head. A quick Bing search (jk) for `$6$ hash` landed me
[here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/210146), so it's `sha-512`. After installing
`$ mkpasswd` (see the previous link for how):

	$ mkpasswd -m sha-512 test
	$6$5xoqSMQ32wdPR$RDcGgk2Jd6LvkkzCSaJJ0s3o73IW.ikMIzSusqOwL3G908XLG4OGjCfOewePNJEYAbiFyKS9p0hoPBTvxMvr61

Structurally the hashes look the same, so now all we have to do is plug a new hash in to
the database to effectively reset the password. How to update an object in a collection?

The help command had this row:

	db.mycoll.help()             help on collection methods

So, running this:

	> db.admin.help()
	...
	    db.admin.update( query, object[, upsert_bool, multi_bool] ) - instead of two flags, you can pass an object with fields: upsert, multi
	    db.admin.updateOne( filter, update, <optional params> ) - update the first matching document, optional parameters are: upsert, w, wtimeout, j
	...

The two above functions look like something we can work with. Let's just try something:

	> db.admin.updateOne({name: 'joonas'}, {x_shadow: '$6$5xoqSMQ32wdPR$RDcGgk2Jd6LvkkzCSaJJ0s3o73IW.ikMIzSusqOwL3G908XLG4OGjCfOewePNJEYAbiFyKS9p0hoPBTvxMvr61'})
	E QUERY    [thread1] Error: the update operation document must contain atomic operators

Ok we're doing something wrong here, so opening the
[docs for updateOne](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateOne/),
we probably need to use `$eq` as query operator and `$set` as update operator:

	> db.admin.updateOne({$eq:{name: "joonas"}}, {$set:{x_shadow: "$6$5xoqSMQ32wdPR$RDcGgk2Jd6LvkkzCSaJJ0s3o73IW.ikMIzSusqOwL3G908XLG4OGjCfOewePNJEYAbiFyKS9p0hoPBTvxMvr61"}})
	WriteError({
	        "index" : 0,
	        "code" : 2,
	        "errmsg" : "unknown top level operator: $eq",
	        "op" : {
	                "q" : {
	                        "$eq" : {
	                                "name" : "joonas"
	                        }
	                },
	                "u" : {
	                        "$set" : {
	                                "x_shadow" : "$6$5xoqSMQ32wdPR$RDcGgk2Jd6LvkkzCSaJJ0s3o73IW.ikMIzSusqOwL3G908XLG4OGjCfOewePNJEYAbiFyKS9p0hoPBTvxMvr61"
	                        }
	                },
	                "multi" : false,
	                "upsert" : false
	        }
	})

The error message says `unknown top level operator: $eq`, that is strange because `$eq` is
the correct operator so it's not immediately clear what I did wrong because the error I
made should have resulted in error message telling me that `$eq` is an unknown field, or
that `name` is an unknown operator..

Looking at more docs, the field name should be before the operator in the query part, but
the update part was correct (`$set` operator as outer, and field name as inner):

	> db.admin.updateOne({name:{$eq: "joonas"}}, {$set:{x_shadow: "$6$5xoqSMQ32wdPR$RDcGgk2Jd6LvkkzCSaJJ0s3o73IW.ikMIzSusqOwL3G908XLG4OGjCfOewePNJEYAbiFyKS9p0hoPBTvxMvr61"}})
	{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 }

Now, trying to log in again, SUCCESS:

Awesome, we just reset the password by poking at the internals. :)
