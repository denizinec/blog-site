Your periodic reminder that [strace](https://strace.io/) is awesome..

On Windows you basically know which partition a file is hosted on by looking at the drive letter.

On Linux there's just a global namespace and it is more difficult to know the partition
of a given file (although I think the indirection in the Unix design is better).

I remembered that `$ df` can show me this info:

	$ df /home/vagrant
	Filesystem                   1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
	/dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root  64440148 16413800  44729888  27% /

Ok sure enough, `/dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root` is just what my program needs to fetch - the
partition the directory is on (mine happens to be at root mount, but it always isn't
the case).

How does it do this? Hmm, just prefix the `df` command with `strace`. I filtered out
non-interesting lines and was left with this:

	$ strace df /home/vagrant
	open("/home/vagrant", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY) = 3
	fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
	close(3)                                = 0
	open("/proc/self/mountinfo", O_RDONLY)  = 3
	fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=0, ...}) = 0

`$ df` is using fstat(), lstat(), stat() and statfs(). All but statfs() return struct like
[this](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstat), so there's no partition location there.

`statfs()` sounded really promising, but there's
[no partition info there](https://linux.die.net/man/2/statfs). It has "Filesystem ID" which
I though I could correlate with data from some other API, but it seemed not be the case.

Ok moving on, `$ df` also accesses `/proc/self/mountinfo`, let's try it:

	$ cat /proc/self/mountinfo
	... (snipped)
	23 0 252:0 / / rw,relatime shared:1 - ext4 /dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root rw,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered
	... (snipped)

Ok there's basically all we need. The format for this output is documented
[here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt).

So all we need to do to resolve `/home/vagrant`Â´s partition is grab the longest match of
mount point from output of `/proc/self/mountinfo`.

E.g., given this entire `mountinfo` .. (some numbers just randomized, they're probably wrong):

	23 0 252:0 / / rw,relatime shared:1 - ext4 /dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root rw,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered
	24 0 0:139 / /home rw,relatime shared:1 - ext4 /dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-homes rw,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered

.. a few mount point resolve examples:

- `/home/vagrant` would be hosted on partition `/dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-homes` (longest match is `/home`)
- `/var/www` would be hosted on `/dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root` (longest match is `/`)

My intuition about this "longest match" seems to be confirmed by coreutils' `df`
[source code](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/e5dae2c6b0bcd0e4ac6e5b212688d223e2e62f79/src/df.c#L716).

There you go, today I learned how to access mount info, quite easily with the help of strace!

p.s. I'm using Go in my program, and I found a
[great library](https://github.com/prometheus/procfs/) for accessing procfs output.
