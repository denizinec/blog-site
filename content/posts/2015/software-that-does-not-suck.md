It's pretty time consuming to research which software you want to use for a specific task. Here I've compiled a list of my preferences for, in my opinion, the best software for different tasks.

Included are also software to avoid, along with reasons.

Web browser
-------------------------

- [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

Avoid:

- Edge: given IE's abysmal historical track record,
  [why would I trust Microsoft not to screw up again](https://joonas.fi/2016/06/23/microsoft-you-make-miserable-software/)?
  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
- Internet Explorer: IE has historically slowed down the progress of the web platform and has always been behind the innovation.

Read PDF files
-------------------------

- [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/): has built-in PDF viewer
- [SumatraPDF](http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/): excellent open source PDF reader - no installation required

Avoid:

- Adobe PDF: slow and bloated

Find out where that disk space went
-------------------------

- [TreeSize free](http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/)

Print to PDF
-------------------------

- [CutePDF Writer](http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp): It was once good software, but now the installer tries to trick users
  into installing shit like Ask toolbar or Winzip registry optimizer.

  However, there seems to be no sensible alternative, so CutePDF is still recommended.

Avoid:

- doPDF: Does not work over remote desktop. Downloads from suspicious looking soft112.com.
  Questionably large download size.
- BullZip PDF: Free version "Sponsored download"
- PDFCreator: flagged suspicious by http://alternativeto.net/software/cutepdf/ (2013-12-13)

Password management
-------------------------

- [Keepass](http://keepass.info/)

Office suite (word processing, spreadsheets etc.)
-------------------------

Free:

- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
- [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/)

Paid:

- [Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com/)

Mount ISOs (CDs/DVDs/BluRays)
-------------------------

- [Virtual CloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html): free & awesome.

Rip CD/DVD/BluRay -> ISO
-------------------------

- [ISO recorder](http://alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm): free.

Encrypt filesystems
-------------------------

- [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/): fork of abandoned TrueCrypt

Surf the web anonymously
-------------------------

- [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
- [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en): Tor + hardened Firefox pre-configured to use Tor

Recover lost files
-------------------------

- [GetDataBack for NTFS](https://www.runtime.org/data-recovery-software.htm): Paid. I've used many times. Ugly UI but works awesome!

Hardware information
-------------------------

- [PiriForm speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy)

Avoid:

- Lavalys Everest: discontinued
- PC Wizard: crashed my PC so I lost unsaved documents

Torrents
-------------------------

- [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/): open source clone of uTorrent

Avoid:

- uTorrent: malware in installer

Audio editing (MP3, Wav, ...)
-------------------------

- [GoldWave](http://www.goldwave.com/): trial but not much restricted. Does simple things (delete/trim/volume maximize/noise filter/fades/...) well.

Edit hex files
-------------------------
