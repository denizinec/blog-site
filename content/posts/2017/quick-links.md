  made me have an epiphany: how CPU works on the lowest of levels. Addition is
  basically just chained XOR gates, and a XOR gate is basically just transistors
  anyway. All this can be explained with
  [wood and marbles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDshWmhF4A)!
  And in the end all higher constructs like 2D, 3D graphics, audio, video can be
  explained with just simple maths, so basically you now understand all that the
  CPU does and that it's not magic. All other complex things like video and audio
  compression codecs/algorithms are just necessary optimizations on top of simple math.
