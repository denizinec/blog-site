My name is Joonas, and I'm a software engineer from Finland. I run
[function61.com](https://function61.com/). For my open source work,
see the GitHub link on the top of this page.

My interests are:

- Improving software architecture, EventSourcing / CQRS
- [Homelabbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), [home automation](https://github.com/function61/hautomo) and [data hoarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/)
- Distributed systems, [infrastructure software](https://github.com/function61/fn61-opencompany)
- Learning better programming languages (Golang, Rust)
- Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc. various electronics projects

I am inspired by these people:

- [Michael Stapelberg](https://twitter.com/zekjur) ("My router doesn't work? I'll write my own networking software for it then..")
- [Ben Cox](https://twitter.com/Benjojo12) ("my USB device isn't supported by modern Linux? I'll reverse engineer and write my own USB drivers for it then..")
- [LiveOverflow](https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow) (teaches about software security via exploits)
- [Catalin Cimpanu](https://twitter.com/campuscodi) (security reporter)
