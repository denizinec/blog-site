Email notification links not working
------------------------------------

Clicks from new comment notifications not taking me to the comment, but instead Disqus homepage (?!):

Signing in is not working
-------------------------

Privacy issues
--------------

The notification links seem to track my clicks:

Twitter login requests too many privileges:

Summary
-------

All systems have problems from time to time, but the amount of issues indicate a systemic problem.
Disqus is garbage.
