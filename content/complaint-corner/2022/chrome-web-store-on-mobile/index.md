Why does it have a button for `[ Add to Desktop ]` when I visit that page on mobile?

Why does it not explain *why I can't add it on mobile?*

It doesn't seem to care whether I try ..

- Brave on Android or
- Chrome on Android

.. the result is the same.

Even more confusing is that when I visit with a desktop, it says:

> Compatible with your device

Why is this compatibility indicator not available on mobile?
I'm more interested in **why I'm not compatible** than an indicator that says I'm compatible!

It seems to be the case that Google hasn't rolled out extension support on mobile Chrome:

Would it have been difficult for Google say "Extensions on mobile Chrome are not supported yet."?

All of this just contributes to mystification of computer programs, it is no wonder people just shrug
and say they don't understand computers. In reality the fault usually lies at incompetent software companies. ðŸ¤·
