I just bought a [mechanical keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard) from Drop.

I didn't sign up for any mailing lists, but here's how they rewarded me after giving them $ 225:

This is only about a week's worth of emails, that I didn't sign up for.

To top it off, from the unsubscribe link you've to separate click to unsubscribe for each different
subject:

{{< video src="separate-unsubscribe" >}}

This is clearly a dark pattern to punish those who wish to unsubscribe.

There's also no "Unsubscribe from all future mailing lists", so you just know that once they add a
new mailing list named "Hot keycaps recommended by Justin Bieber", you'll be by-default-subscribed,
and you've to go unsubscribe from it again.


Update two weeks later
----------------------

The above happened two weeks before. Now it's 23th of April.

They're still sending me spam, despite me having ticked off all checkboxes:
